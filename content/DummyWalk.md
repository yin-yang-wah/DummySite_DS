STEP 1
============
Lorraine. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Back to the future. The hell you doing to my car? Yeah, gimme a Tab.

STEP 2
============
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Well, I guess that's everything. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. I followed you. Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?

Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. We all make mistakes in life, children

STEP 3
=================
Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc Uh, yeah. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Right. Marty, is that you?

Ah well, sort of. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Good morning, Mom. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. I'll call you tonight. You're gonna be in the car with her. You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

STEP 4
============
Okay. Is she pretty? Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. What the hell is a gigawatt?

Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. Wow, you must be rich. Doc, she didn't even look at him. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

This is an [link](https://affectionate-easley-365e1a.netlify.app/) to show how it works.

Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Whoa, wait, Doc. Uh?

Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. That's a big bruise you have there. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.
