The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.

If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.

+ Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT!

+ Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.

The Truth
===============
Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.
